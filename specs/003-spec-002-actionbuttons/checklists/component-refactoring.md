**Total Items**: 60  
**Categories**: 10  
**Traceability Coverage**: 85% (51/60 items reference spec sections or gaps)

**Summary**: This checklist validates the quality of requirements for ActionButtons component refactoring, focusing on completeness, clarity, measurability, and safe refactoring practices. Each item tests whether the requirements themselves are well-written and implementable, not whether the implementation works correctly.
