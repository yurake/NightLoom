**Total Items**: 88
**Categories**: 9
**Traceability Coverage**: 92% (81/88 items reference spec sections or gaps)

**Summary**: This checklist validates the quality of requirements for NightLoom外部LLMサービス統合, focusing on completeness, clarity, measurability, and safe integration practices. Each item tests whether the requirements themselves are well-written and implementable for external LLM service integration, not whether the implementation works correctly.
